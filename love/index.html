i worry about you a lot

i believe in you i have faith in you i trust you, but i know so little and all im sure of is that everythings terribly hard for you

i understand when you dont want to tell me more, you really dont have to, but im afraid you arent fully telling anybody, including yourself

you sleep irregularly many nights, you delete most of your tweets, you go invisible on spotify, i know you arent doing well, but as far as i can tell you try not to show others

im not judging or scolding you, i know this isnt all in your control and not always the wrong thing to do, but its most of what i see and i think its only the surface

still, i can see youre trying, i have seen you shine, you arent lost yet, but none of that is a given and i fear you might slowly be slipping away

if you dont reach out, show that youre struggling, allow yourself to be vulnerable, you will have nothing to hold on to

i know people can be horrible and even when not they will never truly understand you, but besides yourself theyre all you have, and you need help

i try to be here for you although i know im so far away, i hope i can be something safe and constant, i hope i can be of support, i hope i can help

but you need more, a real friend, i dont know if that can be me, i try, i think you try, but still so often i feel like im missing something

maybe i think too much, but i tend to imagine i can mean more to you, that i should be able to get something to spark, i do my best but i rarely seem to be able to connect with you

whether its with the messages i send, or the little things i add to them, or the tiny conversations we have, i always think im a bit off the mark and its very hard for me to tell why or what i can do better

im not blaming you for this at all, i understand that things are very different for you and appreciate however you see me and interact with me, i know youre also doing the best you can, i just wanted to share my perspective with you

but i really think you can find a spark, youre struggling, its dark all around you, everything hurts, and i can imagine you find it hard to believe this

still there is so much beauty in this world, small and big, hidden wherever youre willing to look, its all waiting on you

but you have to learn how to recognize it, thats not easy, you have to be at ease, feel safe and peaceful, trust it to shine for you without any worries

this attitude gets beaten out of you, its vulnerable, maybe even naive, and all the pain youve been through and are still enduring makes you go against this

but if you can be in a safe place and look around with those pure eyes you will find so much you didnt even know youre looking for

there is hope, you can keep going little step by little step, and along the way you will find what you think to have lost and so much more

but you need help, you cant carry your weight all alone, you need people to support you, point you the way, keep you company

i try to be part of that as much as i can
